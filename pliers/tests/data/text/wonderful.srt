1
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,004
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,298
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,718
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,429
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,515
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,226
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,061
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,313
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,732
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,942
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,903
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,696
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,073
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,451
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,578
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,872
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,541
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,464
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,133
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,303
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.
